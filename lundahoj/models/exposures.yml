      Lundahoj bike-sharing analytics dashboard with four key visualizations:
      
      (1) Daily Weather vs Rides - Shows daily ride volume correlated with rain (mm) 
      and wind speed (m/s). Helps identify weather impact on ridership.
      
      (2) Hourly Demand - Bar chart showing average rides by hour of day (0-23). 
      Reveals peak usage times for capacity planning.
      
      (3) Problem Stations - Horizontal bar chart showing stations with highest 
      downtime (hours empty or full). Identifies rebalancing priorities.
      
      (4) Weekly Ride Trend - Line chart showing total rides aggregated by week. 
      Tracks overall system growth and seasonal patterns.
      
      Used by operations team for daily monitoring and by management for 
      strategic planning.
